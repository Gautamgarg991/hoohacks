## Beaconer- The Proximity Marketing Prototype
This project focuses on proximity marketing, enhancing the marketing capabilities and reach of merchants by displaying relevant promos, new launches, and other information on any product or service. It empowers the consumers by providing them with promotions of all categories on a single platform.

## Beaconer is a project consisting of two apps:
1) **Merchant App**- for advertising (<a href="https://github.com/Coding-Owls/Sender">Link</a>)
   
   The merchant's variant of app will continuously transmit low energy ibeacon data packets and any smartphone passing nearby will detect the data packets and display the       promotion, service etc. Multiple smartphones will be able to display the promotions at the same time. Promotions will be fetched continuously from a cloud database.
   
2) **Consumer App**- for recieving the advertisements(<a href = "https://github.com/Coding-Owls/reciever">Link</a>)

   The consumers's variant of the app will detect the low energy data packets and display the promotion, service or announcement made by the merchant. Promotions from multiple    merchants will be displayed subsequently as consumer passes nearby from one merchant to another.
